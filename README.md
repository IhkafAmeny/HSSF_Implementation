## **Model-Heterogeneous Semi-Supervised Federated Learning for ABIDE Images Classification**

This project implements a complete **Heterogeneous Semi-Supervised Federated Learning** approach on the **ABIDE** (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset, using MRI images in `.png` format along with annotations from a `.csv` file.

## üìå Objective
To adapt with ABIDE dataset and implement the **HSSF** approach for :
- Learning from **clients with unlabeled or partially labeled data**
- Handling **heterogeneous models** across different clients (ResNet18, MobileNet, EfficientNet)
- Using a **central server (ResNet101)** for aggregation via prediction distillation


##  HSSF Architecture

1. **Public Supervised Learning (PSL)** ‚Äì clients train locally on publicly labeled data  
2. **Regularity Condensation (RC)** ‚Äì the server collects client predictions (logits) on public data  
3. **Regularity Fusion (RF)** ‚Äì clients distill knowledge from the server via KL divergence  
4. **Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL)** ‚Äì clients apply SA (Self-Assessment) and RPG (Reliable Pseudo-label Generation) on their own unlabeled data

## Dataset
- MRI images come from the ABIDE Preprocessed dataset converted to .png format.
- The file phenotypes_clean1.csv contains labels (autism or control) and subject IDs.
